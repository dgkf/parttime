Description:
    Datetimes and timestamps are invariably an imprecise notation, with any
    partial representation implying some amount of uncertainty. To handle this,
    'parttime' provides classes for embedding partial missingness as a central
    part of its datetime classes. This central feature allows for more ergonomic
    use of datetimes for challenging datetime computation, including
    calculations of overlapping date ranges, imputations, and more thoughtful
    handling of ambiguity that arises from uncertain timezones. This package was
    developed first and foremost with pharmaceutical applcications in mind, but
    aims to be agnostic to application to accommodate general usecases just as
    conveniently.
